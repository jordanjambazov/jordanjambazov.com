I quit smoking. This post serves the purpose of a memo, as well as a public announcement of my intent. I won't write about the health benefits of quitting smoking. I don't quit because of that. I just had enough of it.

During the past 12 years I used to be a heavy smoker - rarely smoking less than a pack of cigarettes per day.

Why did I start smoking in the first place? I guess for the social element of it. People I used to hang out with smoked - and so did I. People with whom I hang out changed accross the years, but the habit stayed.

Smoking isn't cool.
